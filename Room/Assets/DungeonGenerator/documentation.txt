	This asset includes:
		
		- Source code of needed algorithms.
		- MapGenerator, AutoTiling Scripts.
		- DemoScene with appropriate parameters applied.


	How To Use:
		
		- Attach the `MapGenerator` and `AutoTiling` script to GameObject you want to use.
		- Create Singleton GameObject for `Visualization`	(Optional)
		- Assign the appropriate parameters.				(please refer to DemoScene)
		- Start the Coroutine `MapGenerateCoroutine` from `MapGenerator`


	How To Modify:

		- If you want to use ONLY `MapGenerator`, then:
			- REMOVE `[RequireComponent(typeof(AutoTiling))]` from top of script.
			- REMOVE `GetComponent<AutoTiling>().TilingMap();` from `MapGenerateCoroutine` in `MapGenerator`.
			- THEN You can get map arr ONLY.

		- If you don't want to use `Visualize`, then:
			- You don't have to make Singleton gameobject for `Visualization`.
			- You must set `IsVisualizeProgress` to false. (It can occur NULL Error.)

		- For any Other Problems, then:
			- You can leave a comment with any areas that need improvement or features you would like to see.
			- You can email me directly at: ( yeoinho75@gmail.com )
